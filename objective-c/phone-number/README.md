# Phone Number

Write a program that cleans up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.

The rules are as follows:

- If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is bad
  number
- If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1
  and use the last 10 digits
- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then
  it is a bad number
- If the phone number is more than 11 digits assume that it is a bad
  number

We've provided tests, now make them pass.

Hint: Only make one test pass at a time. Disable the others, then flip
each on in turn after you get the current failing one to pass.

## Setup

There are two different methods of getting set up to run the tests with Objective-C:

- Create an Xcode project with a test target which will run the tests.
- Use the ruby gem `objc` as a test runner utility.

Both are described in more detail here: http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-objective-c.html


### Submitting Exercises

When submitting an exercise, make sure your solution file is in the same directory as the test code.

For example, if you're submitting `Bob.m` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/objective-c/bob/Bob.m`.
